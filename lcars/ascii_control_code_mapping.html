<h1> Ascii control codes (control characters, C0&nbsp;controls) </h1>

<P>The following document lists the control codes (control characters) in and in newer character code
standards like Unicode, which generally try to be compatible with Ascii in the Ascii code range (positions 0 through 127). 
There  is also an unofficial proposed mapping to fictional auduible UI elements.</P>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The first column shows the widely used "control-something"
       name used for control codes. It relates to the fact that on
       a keyboard, it is often possible to generate a control code
       using the control (Ctrl, Ctl) key and a normal key.
  <li> The column <cite>C0 of ISO 646</cite> quotes the definition
       in that document, with typos fixed, and with references to
       characters and code positions changed to use Unicode names
       and modern terms.
